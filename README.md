# wordle-bot
This program will solve the daily wordle or any five letter word on the official NYT wordle list. 
# How to play 
* Think of a five letter word (This word has to be in the official NYT wordle list)
* The word "CRANE" is always used as a starter word that the bot has guessed
* If a letter in "CRANE" is not in the word that you are thinking of then tap once on the letter to turn it gray
* If a letter in "CRANE" is in your word but not in the correct spot then tap twice on the letter to turn it yellow
* If a letter in "CRANE" is in the correct spot as a letter in the word that you are thinking of, then tap on the letter three times to turn it green
* Once you have turned all the letters in "CRANE" as specific color, press the "Get Word" button to get the next word that the bot will guess
* Reapet the steps with the new word until the bot has correctly guessed your word
# Example
* Lets say we choose "Brain" as the answer to the wordle
* We must tap on 'C' and 'E' once to turn it gray because 'C' and 'E' do not apear in "BRAIN"
* We must tap twice on 'N' to turn it yellow because 'N' is in "BRAIN" but it is not in the correct spot
* We must tap three times on 'R' and 'A' to turn it green because both "CRANE" and "BRAIN" have 'R' and 'A' in the 2nd and 3rd position respectively
* After clicking on the "Get Word" button we get the word "AWAIT"
* We must trun 'W' and 'T' gray because they do not apear in "BRAIN", turn the first 'A'yellow because it is in "BRAIN" but not in the correct spot and finally turn the 2nd 'A' and 'I' green because they are in the correct spot
*  Click on "Get Word" and do the same thing again until the bot gets "BRAIN" as its answer
